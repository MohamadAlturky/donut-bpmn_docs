# Intro

Let's discover **The FlowMiner Tool**.

## Overview

FlowMiner is an agent based llm **built with **[ollama](https://ollama.com/)** models and **[crewai library](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/CrewAI)**,** it's optimized to generate bpmn digrams from textual description.

## Notes

- we don't have money ðŸ˜­ so we can't use very large language models `because we need an expensive machine to host a big model` or `give our money to openai to get an api-key for chatgpt` so:

  > we can't give the llm a big task and let it work without optimize it's result.

  > the window size of the llm is small so we will divide the big tasks into smaller ones.

`in the next sections we will discover how to build this tool.`

<!--
### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies. -->
<!--
## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus. -->

<!--
## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
